Physical exercises are helpful to make us healthier as well as to keep us well mentally. So if we want to keep ourselves fit, we have to go in for sports or games.

People play games – in some games each person is for himself, in others there are teams. Some games are quiet, others are very lively. Games that take a great deal of athletic skill are often called sports. Football (soccer), tennis, hockey, basketball, for instance, are sports. We may go in for a great variety of sports and games. Some kinds of sports need simple equipments and facilities, other – rather complex ones.

First touch to sports and games we make in childhood. Later on in school we discover our favourite sports and games. As far as I am concerned I go in for football, table tennis, swimming, chess, and some others.
